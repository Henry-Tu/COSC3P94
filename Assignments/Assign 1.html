			<h3> Paragraphs </h3>

			<p>Hello, This is some <strong> awesome </strong> text. This site is for
				my IASC 1P02 Assignment 1 submition. If you are not involved in the
				marking this assignment why are you here? Are you being a <em> creep
				</em>? I am <em> sooo </em> sorry. I shouldn't be making assumptions
				like that. Anyways, I hope you have a good day! </p>

				<p>Did you ever hear the tragedy of <strong>Darth Plagueis The
					Wise</strong>? I thought not. It's not a story the <em> Jedi </em>
					would tell you. It's a <strong> Sith </strong> legend. Darth Plagueis
					was a <strong> Dark Lord of the Sith</strong>, so <strong> powerful
					</strong> and so <em> wise </em> he could use the Force to influence the
					midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side
					that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark
					side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be
					<em> unnatural</em>. He became so powerful… the only thing he was
					afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
					Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his
					apprentice killed him in his sleep. <em> Ironic</em>. He could save
					others from death, but not himself.
